## MangaSplitter

This is a tool that splits the scanned images of a manga in half, where there are scanned double-pages. I've realized this program in order to have a better
reading experience on my old ebook, because the zoom was very slow and the original double images becomes unreadable.

## Installation

To use this tool just download the compiled program from the release section, according to your os.
